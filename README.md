# DATA1030-FINALPROJECT

Using Kaggle Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction, we apply a reduced-features machine learning pipeline to solve the following classification problem: Can we predict whether a patient has heart disease given data about their overall health?

This can be run with a standard python 3.9 installation. To install any packages that are used in this project, please consult the environment file data1030.yml
